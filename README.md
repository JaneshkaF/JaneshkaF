### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Although I am new to software, I am eager to continue to learn and grow my skill set!

My goal is to be able to make any of your front end dreams come true! 

âœ¨

In the perfect world, I would master programming overnight! (hehe)  ðŸ’»  But since I live in reality, I will have to continue typing away...after all, nobody ever fully PERFECTS coding, right?!
