### <h1 align="center"> Hi there! Im Janeshka,but you can call me Nesh ðŸ‘‹

  <h3 align="center">I really enjoy working on the front end side of web dev. Im all for making things look nice and appealing to an audience! I also enjoy working with SQL. One of my goals is to be able to land a front end developer position for a company looking to add visual value to their website or app. Although I am new to software, I am eager to continue to learn and grow my skill set! If you have any tips or pointers or if you just want to chat code, feel free to reach out!</h3>

My goal is to be able to make any of your front end dreams come true!
